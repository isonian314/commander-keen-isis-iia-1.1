Custom Maps for Mystery of Isis IIa
-----------------------------------


Overall process:

1. Download Tiled MapEditor (www.mapeditor.org)
2. Run editor, and check Edit/Preferences is set to "Base 64 (gzip compressed)"
3. Make a copy of sample.tmx
4. Edit level, and load in Isis IIa via "Options > Load Custom Map"
5. Make sure tiles.png, tiles_info.png and tiles_sprites.png are in the same directory you are working in


Layers:

The levels have a total of 8 layers:

SPRITES: Keen starting position/direction, background number, enemies, doors, items, keys, powerups, platforms, switches, weather
INFO: Platform properties (flat, slopes, etc), water, enemy initial direction, platform directions, switch functionality, door functionality, exits
TransFG: Translucent foreground (e.g., windows)
FG2: Foreground layer 2
FG1: Foreground layer 1
BG2: Background layer 2
BG1: Background layer 1
TransBG: Translucent background (e.g., windows)

Note that BG1/BG2 and FG1/FG2 are compressed in-game, and exist to make editing easier. It's easiest to stick to the following conventions when editing levels:

BG1 - the background of an inside room (e.g. a cave), where you do not want any parallaxing background seen
BG2 - platforms
FG1 - foreground items
FG2 - occasionally you may have 2 foreground layers


Tips:

- If something doesn't work, check you haven't got an INFO tile on a GRAPHICS layer, or vise verse
- For locked doors & exploding rocks, don't forget the associated INFO tiles, which get deleted when the key is inserted (or rock is shot)
- For unlocked doors, the odd INFO tile needs to be on the left, and the even tile on the right (helps to "snap" Keen to the correct spot)
- The rain, snow & cloud effects depend on the position at which the tile is placed
- You can start Keen off with less health by using the -1, -2, -5 SPRITE tiles
- I generally like to have a 1-tile border of SOLID INFO tiles around the entire level (stops enemies & bullets going out of bounds) - since error checking is not perfect
- Music cannot be altered, the default song plays for all custom levels
- The order and naming of the layers is important; do not modify these!
